# cv-measure
This application uses computer vision to identify reference objects and target objects in an image and uses a technique known as homography to estimate the dimensions of the target objects based on the known dimensions of a reference object. It can be extended with the use of a landmark detection agent to obtain a much higher degree of accuracy.
